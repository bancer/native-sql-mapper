# native-sql-mapper
A lightweight extension for the CakePHP ORM that converts prepared PDO statements into fully mapped result sets. It infers entities and associations from CakePHP-style aliases, supports deep and belongsToMany relations, and builds nested entity graphs automatically with strict alias validation.
